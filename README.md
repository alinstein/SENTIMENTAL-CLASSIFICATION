#  Feature Selection for Classification Using Genetic Algorithm

The objective of this project is to minimise the number of features using Genetic algorithm for classificating the dataset. 
 
In our project, we have chosen 4 various classification techniques, namely: 
 
1. K-means Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, 
2. Logistic Regression classifier, 
3. Decision Tree classifier, 
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier


## Getting Started

The code for the project implemented in the file "Main.mat" 

Enter the values for the following varible before running the main program, default values are given in program:

(i):Classifier: One among the above mentioned classifiers is chosen. 
(ii):Required Variables:       
(iii)Chromosomes( N = 10), 
(iv)Number of generations (T = 20), 
(v) Mutation (MR = 0.01) 
(vi)Cross Over Ratio (CR1 = 0.8) 
(vii) Number of Crossovers (CR2 = 8) 


### Results

Following table compares various classifiers:
