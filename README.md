# SENTIMENTAL CLASSIFICATION OF MOVIE REVIEWS ON IMDB AND ROTTEN TOMATOES DATASETS 

This project implements machine learning algorithms like Multinomial Naïve Bayes, SVM,  XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and and LSTM Neural Network for the  sentimental analysis of movie reviews. Two datasets used in this project are IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes dataset. The IMDB dataset contains two labels and the Rotten Tomatoes dataset has 5 labels. The first stage of the project was to preprocess the dataset. Later on, we converted the filtered dataset from sentence structure into a sparse matrix form. Finally , the processed dataset was used to fit the models. We are  able to achieve an efficiency of 66% and 89% for the IMDB and the Rotten Tomatoes dataset respectively. 
 
In our project, we have chosen a few classification techniques, namely: 
 
1. K-means Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, 
2. Logistic Regression classifier, 
3. Decision Tree classifier, 
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
5. Random Forest
6. LSTM Neural Network
