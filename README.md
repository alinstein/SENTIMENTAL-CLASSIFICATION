# Comparison of Sentiment Analysis on Machine learning and Deep learning models

This project implements machine learning algorithms like Multinomial Naïve Bayes, SVM,  XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, deep learning models like LSTM and GRU Neural Network, and finally on Transoformer Models for the  sentimental analysis of movie reviews. 
 
In our project, we have chosen a few classification techniques, namely: 
 
1. K-means Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, 
2. Logistic Regression classifier, 
3. Decision Tree classifier, 
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
5. Random Forest
6. LSTM Neural Network
7. GRU Neural Network
8. BERT Transformer
9. XLNet Transformer
