# SENTIMENTAL CLASSIFICATION OF MOVIE REVIEWS ON IMDB AND ROTTEN TOMATOES DATASETS 

This project implements machine learning algorithms like Multinomial Naïve Bayes, SVM,  XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and and LSTM Neural Network for the  sentimental analysis of movie reviews. We are able achieve an efficiency of 66% and 89% for the IMDB and the Rotten Tomatoes dataset respectively. 
 
In our project, we have chosen a few classification techniques, namely: 
 
1. K-means Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, 
2. Logistic Regression classifier, 
3. Decision Tree classifier, 
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
5. Random Forest
6. LSTM Neural Network

## Getting Started

The code for the project implemented in the file "SENTIMENTAL_CLASSIFCATION.ipynb".
